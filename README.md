# FPredict

(The project is the assignment of 2024 fall DSAA6000M in HKUST-GZ)

In this project, we plan to use amino acid sequences and their associated physical parameters, such as mutations, fluorescence properties and structural data as training dataset for deep learning models, which could be collected from FPbase containing detailed information of 1,073 FPs. Our goal is to predict specific physical parameters of FPs, such as fluorescence colors, intensities and lifetimes. From our model, we would like to screen for brighter or acid-resistant FPs, which have significant potential in single-molecule imaging or correlative light and electron microscopy.
